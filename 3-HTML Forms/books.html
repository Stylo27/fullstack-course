    <h1>Additional info</h1>
    <p>
      <cite>In this powerhouse of suspense</cite> - as brilliantly imagined as Jurassic Park and The Ruins - scientists have made a startling discovery: A fragment of a lost continent, an island with an ecosystem unlike any they’ve seen before...an ecosystem that could topple ours like a house of cards. The time is now. The place is the Trident, a long-range research vessel hired by the reality TV show Sealife. Aboard is a cast of ambitious young scientists. With a director dying for drama, tiny Henders Island might be just what the show needs. Until the first scientist sets foot on Henders - and the ultimate test of survival begins...

      For when they reach the island’s shores, scientists are utterly unprepared for what they find - creatures unlike any ever recorded in natural history. This is not a lost world frozen in time, an island of mutants, or a lab where science has gone mad: This is the Earth as it might have looked after evolving on a separate path for half a billion years.

      Soon the scientists will stumble on something more shocking than anything humanity has ever encountered: Because among the terrors of Henders Island, one life form defies any scientific theory - and must be saved at any cost.
